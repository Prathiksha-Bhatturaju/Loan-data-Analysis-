**Problem Statement: Uber Trip Analysis**

Financial institutions need to understand loan applicant behavior, assess credit risk, and monitor default trends to make informed lending decisions. This project uses Power BI dashboards to analyze loan distributions, default rates, and applicant demographics across factors such as employment type, income, age, marital status, and credit score. The dashboards provide actionable insights into high-risk segments, financial risk metrics, and applicant profiles, helping stakeholders optimize lending strategies and mitigate default risk.

**Steps followed**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow for Uber trip data:

**1. Prerequisites & Setup :** Data Ingestion & Storage: Loaded raw loan data from Excel/CSV files into Power BI (or connected via BigQuery/GCP if applicable) for centralized analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates) to ensure dataset accuracy and consistency.

**3. Data Modeling:** Built a data model with relationships, calendar tables, and measure tables for accurate time intelligence and KPI tracking.

**4. Reporting & Dashboards:** Developed 3 interactive dashboards: Loan Default Overview, Financial Risk Metrics, and Applicant Demographics & Financial Profile.

**5. Deployment & Automation:** Published the report to Power BI Service and scheduled data refreshes to keep dashboards updated with the latest data.

**6. Documentation & Collaboration:** Published reports in Power BI Service and shared project files, datasets, DAX measures, and workflow on GitHub for reproducibility.
